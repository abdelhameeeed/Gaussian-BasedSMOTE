# Gaussian-BasedSMOTE
## Handling Imbalanced Data 
### this repository contains an implementation to Gaussian-BasedSMOTE to handle imbalanced data to enhance the model performance .
### first the true class labels was too little with comparison to false labels and this lead to a poor performance of the Model , you can see the percentage in the Notebook
### after implementing Gaussian-BasedSMOTE we have eqaul class labels and found that it really enhance model performance .
### Gaussian-BasedSMOTE works on the basis of Normal distribution so it generates a random points related to the minority class and take in consideration the overgeneration problem .
